Solution-Mechanism-Guide (SMG)
==============================

The Solution Mechanism Guide (SMG) is a tool to educate our scientists and managers about what tools are available for them to utilize in order to solve the challenges of spaceflight.  This is a web based tool that provides a step-by-step wizard that walks project managers through a process to find the available solutions that best match their project scope, schedule, and budget.   This code also includes adminstrator functions that allow the customization of the information and process used by the wizard.

This software was developed by the NASA Tournament Lab (NTL).
